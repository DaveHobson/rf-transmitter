# rf-transmitter

An RF transmitter to control 'The Big Fan by Hunter Pacific International' installed in my beer garden.
Will be expanded in future to control sunlight motorised blinds as well.

### main.py 
runs on a rpi PICO which has a 'Linx Technologies TXM-433-LR' 433 MHz RF transmitter attached.
The PICO is wired to a rpi UART tx and receives commands over serial.

### serial.py 
is a Python script on the rpi which is executed via SSH, with the command passed in as the first argument being sent over the wire to the PICO.
This script is executed from iOS shortcuts on our iPhones and from my Audio Visual control system.
